# Augmented Reality (AR) Integration for MetaPlexus
This repository contains the AR integration components for MetaPlexus, a platform that leverages augmented reality to enhance user experience.

## Overview
The AR integration consists of three main components:

1. **AR Object Recognition**: Recognizes objects in the user's environment and provides relevant information.
2. **AR Scene Understanding**: Analyzes the user's surroundings and provides a 3D representation of the environment.
3. **AR Interaction**: Enables users to interact with virtual objects in their environment.

## AR Object Recognition
The AR object recognition component uses computer vision algorithms to recognize objects in the user's environment. The following algorithms are implemented:

* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
* Object Detection Architectures (e.g. YOLO, SSD)

## AR Scene Understanding
The AR scene understanding component uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's surroundings and provide a 3D representation of the environment. The following algorithms are implemented:

* Structure from Motion (SfM)
* Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)

## AR Interaction
The AR interaction component enables users to interact with virtual objects in their environment. The following interaction methods are supported:

* Gesture recognition
* Voice commands
* Hand tracking

## Features
* Real-time object recognition and tracking
* 3D scene reconstruction and visualization
* Seamless interaction with virtual objects

## Getting Started
