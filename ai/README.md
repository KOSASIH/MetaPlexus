# AI Integration for MetaPlexus
This repository contains the AI integration components for MetaPlexus, a platform that leverages artificial intelligence to enhance user experience.

## Overview
The AI integration consists of three main components:

1. **AI-powered Predictive Analytics**: Uses machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior, predict trends, and provide insights for informed decision-making.
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enables users to interact with the platform using voice commands or text-based input.
3. **AI-driven Content Generation**: Generates high-quality content, such as articles, videos, or images, to enhance user engagement.

## Predictive Analytics
The predictive analytics component uses machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and predict trends. The following algorithms are implemented:

* Collaborative filtering
* Decision trees
* Random forests
* Gradient boosting

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
The NLP component enables users to interact with the platform using voice commands or text-based input. The following NLP libraries are used:

* NLTK
* spaCy

## AI-driven Content Generation
The AI-driven content generation component uses machine learning algorithms to generate high-quality content. The following algorithms are implemented:

* Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
* Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

## Getting Started
### Installation
